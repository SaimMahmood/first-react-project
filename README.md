# first-react-project
My first time using react and material-ui5 in attempt to recreate one of the "templates" available in the official documentation, from scratch.


I used "makeStyles" to style it as close to the original as possible and mui's grid system to put everything where it belongs. I might revisit it and make it a fully functional application, but for now, its a very dead, pretty looking project that I am proud of, considering the fact that this was my first attempt at using either technology.
